🏫 Campus Navigation & Utility Planner
Data Structures Assignment – Trees & Graph Algorithms (Python Implementation)

This project implements a complete Campus Navigation and Utility Planner using core Data Structures and Algorithms such as Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graphs, Expression Trees, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and Kruskal’s Algorithm.

The system models a university campus, manages building information, computes optimal navigation routes, and generates minimum-cost utility layouts.

📌 Project Features
✔ Binary Search Tree (BST)

Stores building data (ID, name, location)

Supports:

Insert

Search

Inorder Traversal

Preorder Traversal

Postorder Traversal

✔ AVL Tree (Self-balancing BST)

Stores the same building records as BST

Performs automatic balancing

Demonstrates rotations: LL, RR, LR, RL

Compares height vs normal BST

✔ Graph Representation of Campus

Each building = Node

Path between buildings = Edge

Implemented using:

Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency List

✔ Graph Traversals

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

✔ Optimal Path Finding

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Computes shortest route between buildings

✔ Utility Planning (Minimum Spanning Tree)

Kruskal’s Algorithm

Finds the most cost-efficient cable layout

✔ Expression Tree

Builds and evaluates expression trees

Used for sample energy bill calculation
